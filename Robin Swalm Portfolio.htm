Responsive Portfolio
-I have made my application responsive so it renders well on a variety of devices (computer or laptop, tablet, smartphone).
-I have used the Bootstrap CSS framework which has made my portfolio mobile responsive.
-I created the following files, "index.html", "portfolio.html", and "contact.html"
-Using Bootstrap I developed my portfolio with a navbar, a responsive layout, and responsive images.
-The use of media queries in my portfolio page have been minimized.
