                            Ever since I was a young child Iʻve always been fascinated with how things work. I come from a long line of family musicians; I have an excellent ear for music. I started taking music lessons when I was three years old. Even then I would ask my teacher “why” instead of “how”. I needed to know how things work. Computing/coding is much the same as music. Music doesnʻt just happen. It takes lots of planning and creating and must (in most cases) follow strictly to the score in order to produce the music it was created for. This is one reason why coding is so intriguing to me.
          
          
              I excelled in math in elementary school and in high school because it helped me understand the purpose it was created for. Even the most convoluted Calculus equation is composed of lots of smaller seemingly simple equations that when solved systematically help to solve the bigger equation.
              
              
              My quest to know how things work got me in trouble when at age 15 I totally dismantled my fatherʻs lawnmower just to see how it worked. He wasnʻt very happy but he said it was pretty cool how I was able to re-assemble it. This quest I have to find out how things work is what has leads me to coding.  I want to be the one who creates (or helps create) particular software that people use for work or for pleasure. It would be really satisfying to know I created software that runs well and is user friendly.
              
              
              Since I was in grade nine I would look at websites and go straight to the code to see what it looked like. It was fascinating to me even though at the time I didnʻt understand very much of it. This is what drives me forward to learn more about coding and programming language. As the world becomes more and more digital I was to play a role in helping people.
